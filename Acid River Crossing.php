        <h2>About the Acid River Crossing Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Acid River Crossing Challenge, an exhilarating team-building activity that will test your group's coordination, communication, and strategic thinking. In this challenge, teams of 10 people each will navigate an "acid river" by crossing a series of boxes, with their legs tied together in a train-like formation. The mission is to reach the other side without falling into the "acid." Teams that successfully conquer the river and reach the finish line first will be crowned the Acid River Navigators!

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <h4>Team Formation:</h4>
        <p>Divide participants into four teams, each consisting of 10 members. Designate a start point and a finish line for the Acid River Crossing Challenge.</p>
        
        <h4>Leg Tying:</h4>
        <p>Tie the legs of each team together, forming a train-like structure. Ensure that participants are securely and comfortably connected.</p>
        
        <h4>Box Setup:</h4>
        <p>Place a series of boxes or designated spots on the ground, forming a pathway across the "acid river." The boxes act as safe zones.</p>
        
        <h4>Starting Line:</h4>
        <p>All teams gather at the starting line, ready to embark on the challenge with their tied legs. The objective is to cross the "acid river" by moving from box to box without touching the ground.</p>
        
        <h4>River Crossing Relay:</h4>
        <p>On a signal, the first team member steps onto the first box, followed by the rest of the team in a coordinated manner. The challenge is to maintain balance, teamwork, and coordination to prevent anyone from falling.</p>
        
        <h4>Box Navigation:</h4>
         <p>Teams must strategize on the best way to move from box to box. Each time a team member's foot touches the ground, they need to return to the starting point.</p>
        
        <h4>Collaborative Effort:</h4>
        <p>As teams progress, they must work together to ensure everyone safely reaches each box. Effective communication is essential to navigate turns, obstacles, and challenges.</p>
        
        <h4>Finish Line:</h4>
        <p>The challenge concludes when the entire team successfully reaches the finish line without any team member touching the ground. A referee or facilitator oversees the challenge to ensure fair play.</p>
        
        <h4>Winning Team:</h4>
        <p>The team that crosses the Acid River and reaches the finish line first, with all members completing the challenge successfully, is declared the winner.</p>
